Project Part I (deadline: 13.01) — 70%

Develop an algorithm and its implementation that can automatically decompose complex DFG models into smaller, manageable subprocesses by identifying key model components and splitting them into subprocesses. You may use GPT to identify the elements and to name (label) each subprocess. Provide a user interface that allows zooming in and out of the decomposed graph. Test the algorithm on several sample logs.

Projects must be presented in class on 13.01, where we will test them using various sample examples.
Project Part II (deadline: 27.01) — 30%

Adapt your solution to BPMN models. This includes enabling automatic decomposition of BPMN process models into smaller subprocesses using the approach developed in Part I, as well as naming (labeling) the identified subprocesses.

Test the adapted solution on several sample BPMN models.

Projects must be presented in class on 27.01, where we will test them using various sample examples.
